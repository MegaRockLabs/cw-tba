# CW82: Token Bound Account with Credentials

The **Credentials Contract** is an advanced version of the Token Bound Account that provides enhanced authentication and access control features. Think of it as a premium smart wallet that:
Supports multiple wallet types and signing methods

## üåü Advanced Features

Unlike the base account contract, the credentials version provides:

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Combine different proof methods
- **Signature Verification**: Advanced cryptographic proof validation
- **Replay Protection**: Enhanced protection against replay attacks
- **Credential Rotation**: Safely update authentication methods

## üö® Security Considerations

- **Ultimate Authority**: NFT owner can always override the credentials
- **Permission Grants**: Must prove ownership through one of the existing credentials to add more
- **Fraud Prevention**: Provides features that help fraud prevention but require intergarion from a marketplace and vigilance from a user to ensure fair traiding

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **Gas Costs**

- Credential operations cost more gas than basic account operations
- Signature validation adds computational overhead
- Consider gas costs when designing permission structures

### **Complexity Management**

- More credentials = more complexity to manage
- Start simple and add complexity as needed

### **Compatibility**

- Fully compatible with the base TBA account contract
- Can be upgraded from base accounts while preserving assets
- Works with all existing TBA registry functionality
